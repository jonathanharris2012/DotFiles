## What You Get From This Repo

This is a simply a collection of DotFiles. Currently for PowerShell and Bash. Someday I'll put the files in the right location with a script.

## Getting Started

Clone the repo. Dump the files in the correct locations. Profit.
Note that I'm using WSL with Ubuntu for the Bash CLI.

## File Locations

    * C:\Users\<User>\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1
    * Or $HOME\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1
